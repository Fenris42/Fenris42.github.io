## Project Forest

[Github Repository](https://github.com/Fenris42/Project_Forest){:target="_blank"}

### Status:
- Shelved  

### Description:

A top-down dungeon crawler RPG inspired by [Cult of the Lamb.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1313140/Cult_of_the_Lamb/){:target="_blank"}

### Goals:

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Implement levels using a tilemap

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Movement and attacks in 4 directions (up, down, left, right)

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Mob AI that uses a single configurable template for class selection and attacks

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Mob AI that tracks and reacts to players position and has obstacle avoidance

![X](assets/images/icons/x.png){:class="icon"} Procedural dungeon generation

![X](assets/images/icons/x.png){:class="icon"} A completed prototype

### Retrospective:

- We had a hard time finding the fun and direction of the game.
- The team was initially excited about the project but in reality didn’t have enough time to dedicate to it. This was the main factor behind the project being shelved, since it had been scoped as a team effort.
- Top-down added more directions of travel and more freedom of design, but it increased programming complexity more than initially thought.
- The Unity asset store had a limited selection of art for this camera angle.
- Assets required more sprites and animations to cover front and back directions.
- Camera angle made perspectives difficult to manage. For example, doors on the left, right and bottom of the screen didn’t look right.

## Project Sebastion

![Sebastion](assets/images/screenshots/project_sebastion.png)

[![Download](assets/images/icons/download.png){:class='icon icon-download'}](https://github.com/Fenris42/Project_Sebastion){:target="_blank"}
[Github Repository](https://github.com/Fenris42/Project_Sebastion){:target="_blank"}

### Status:
- Shelved  

### Description:

A tower defense game inspired by [Plants vs Zombies.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3590/Plants_vs_Zombies_GOTY_Edition/){:target="_blank"} Control an archer on the castle wall and shoot oncoming enemies.

### Goals:

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} First attempt at creating a game not from a tutorial or template

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Multiple scenes

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Instantiated enemies

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Basic mob AI to move to attack range and attack wall

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Wave spawning system

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Mobs drop loot on death that the player can retrieve

![X](assets/images/icons/x.png){:class="icon"} A completed prototype

### Retrospective:

- The game was shelved due to a lack of team alignment over direction.
- While the game seemed achievable thanks to simple AI, player movement, and reuse of characters and levels, it was in an older, relatively unpopular genre.
- A lack of foresight caused by my programming inexperience at the time made scaling difficult. Code quickly became duplicated and segmented into multiple code bases, which made changes time consuming.
- I sharpened my team collaboration and communication skills.
- I used Github to distribute updates and get quick feedback after implementing each feature, in order to save time and effort if changes were needed.

### Status:
- Complete  

### Description:

My first independent project. I gave myself an introduction to game development by prototyping a project in which I implemented a variety of common game systems. I did so in a sandbox environment, which allowed me to experiment freely.

### Goals:

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Mob loot

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Inventory system

### Retrospective:

- I successfully taught myself how to implement a variety of systems.
- I learned a great deal about game programming and identified areas of strengths and areas in need of improvement.
