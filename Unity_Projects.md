**Status:** Shelved  

**Description:**

A top down dungeon crawler RPG

**Goals:**

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Implement levels using a tilemap

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Movement and attacks in 4 directions

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Mob AI that uses a single configurable template
* Class selection dropdown from editor with configurable weights to attacks

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Mob AI that tracks and reacts to players position and has collision avoidance

**Retrospective:**

- Top down added more directions of travel and more freedom of design, however it increased programming complexity more than initially thought
	- Asset store had limited selection of art for this camera angle
	- Assets required more sprites and animations to cover front and back directions
	- Camera angle made perspectives difficult to manage such as doors on the left, right and bottom of screen not looking right
- Had a hard time finding the fun and direction of the game
