[Github Repository](https://github.com/Fenris42/Project_Forest){:target="_blank"}

### Status:
- Shelved  

### Description:

A top-down dungeon crawler RPG inspired by [Cult of the Lamb.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1313140/Cult_of_the_Lamb/){:target="_blank"}

### Goals:

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Implement levels using a tilemap

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Movement and attacks in 4 directions (up, down, left, right)

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Mob AI that uses a single configurable template for class selection and attacks

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Mob AI that tracks and reacts to players position and has obstacle avoidance

![X](assets/images/icons/x.png){:class="icon"} Procedural dungeon generation

![X](assets/images/icons/x.png){:class="icon"} A completed prototype

### Retrospective:

- Had a hard time finding the fun and direction of the game.
- Team was initially excited about the project but in reality didn't have enough time to dedicate it. Initially scoped as a team effort, project was shelved primarily because of this factor.
- Top-down added more directions of travel and more freedom of design, but it increased programming complexity more than initially thought.
- Asset store had limited selection of art for this camera angle.
- Assets required more sprites and animations to cover front and back directions.
- Camera angle made perspectives difficult to manage. For example doors on the left, right and bottom of screen didn't look right.

## Project Sebastion

[![Download](assets/images/icons/download.png){:class='icon icon-download'}](https://github.com/Fenris42/Project_Sebastion){:target="_blank"}
[Github Repository](https://github.com/Fenris42/Project_Sebastion){:target="_blank"}

### Status:
- Shelved  

### Description:

A tower defense game inspired by [Plants vs Zombies.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3590/Plants_vs_Zombies_GOTY_Edition/){:target="_blank"} Control an archer on the castle wall directly and shoot on coming enemies.

### Goals:

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} First attempt at creating a game not from a tutorial or template

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Multiple scenes

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Instantiated enemies

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Basic mob AI to move to attack range and attack wall

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Wave spawning system

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Mobs drop loot on death that the player can retrieve

![X](assets/images/icons/x.png){:class="icon"} A completed prototype

### Retrospective:

- Game shelved due to lack of team alignment over direction.
- Game based on an older genre of games that may not be populuar in todays market. However this style of game seemed accomplishable with simple AI, player movement and reuse of characters and levels.
- Difficulty scaling due to a lack of foresight at my current programming skill level. Code quickly became duplicated and segmented into multiple code bases and made changes time consuming.
- Sharpened team collaboration and communication skills.
- Used Github to distribute updates and get quick feedback after implementing each feature in order to save time and effort if changes where needed.

### Status:
- Complete  

### Description:

My first independent project where I was prototyping in a sandbox style by implementing a variety of common game systems in preparation to start a real attempt at making a game. This was to allow myself to make mistakes and a mess care free in order to learn how to better implement them in the future while getting more familiar with game development.

### Goals:

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Basic Mobs with simple AI and attack

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Collision detection

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Mob loot

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Inventory system

### Retrospective:

- Successfully implemented a variety of systems on my own.
- Learned a great deal about game programming and identified areas of strengths and areas in need of improvement.
