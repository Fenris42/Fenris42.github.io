**Status:** Shelved  


**Description:**

A top down dungeon crawler RPG


**Goals:**

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Implement levels using a tilemap

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Movement and attacks in 4 directions

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Mob AI that uses a single configurable template for class selection and attacks

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Mob AI that tracks and reacts to players position and has collision avoidance

![X](assets/images/icons/x.png){:class="icon"} Procedural dungeon generation

![X](assets/images/icons/x.png){:class="icon"} A completed prototype


**Retrospective:**

- Had a hard time finding the fun and direction of the game
- Team was initially excited about project but in reality didnt have enough time to dedicate to the project
- Top down added more directions of travel and more freedom of design, however it increased programming complexity more than initially thought
- Asset store had limited selection of art for this camera angle
- Assets required more sprites and animations to cover front and back directions
- Camera angle made perspectives difficult to manage such as doors on the left, right and bottom of screen not looking right

**Status:** Shelved  


**Description:**

A wave and lane based protect the tower game


**Goals:**

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} First attempt at creating a game not from a tutorial or template

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Multiple scenes

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Instantiated enemies

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Basic Mob AI to move to attack range and attack wall

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Wave spawning system

![Check](assets/images/icons/check.png){:class="icon"} Mobs dropped loot on death thats able to be retrieved by player

![X](assets/images/icons/x.png){:class="icon"} A completed prototype


**Retrospective:**

- Game shelved due to game team breaking up over creative differences and direction
- Game based on an out dated genre. However one that seemed accomplishable
- Mobs where completely seperate code bases and lead to duplicated code and difficulty updating across all enemies
- Learned to collaborate on game development through weekly meetings and daily chat messaging
- Used Github to collaborate through commits and get quick feedback after implementing each feature to not invest to much time and effort if something needed changes

**Status:** Complete  


**Description:**

My first indipendent "game" where I was prototyping in a sandbox style by implementing a variety of common game systems in preparation to start a real attempt at making a game. This was to allow myself to make mistakes and a mess care free in order to learn how to better implement them in the future while getting more familiar with game development.

**Retrospective:**

- Successfully implemented a variety of systems on my own and through referencing tutorials
- Gained a lot of knowledge quickly about game programming and identified areas for future improvement
