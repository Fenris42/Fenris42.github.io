### Language:
- Powershell

### Description:

When downloading an asset pack from the Unity Asset Store, I move it out of my Unity project and into a separate local library of assets on my PC. I do this so that I only import the required files into my games, as well as to make browsing and reuse of assets easier. However, because Unity creates a .meta file for each folder and file in your Unity project, browsing the moved files in a file explorer is miserable and requires a lot of cleanup. 

This script will find and purge all .meta files in your local asset library to make browsing in a file explorer much more pleasant.
