- A game about a post human world where beavers are now the domenant species
- The player builds a town with farms, industry, homes and entertainments in the goal to have a thriving community with a high well being score
- Typical game loop is alternating seasons of temperate where water flows and everything is nice then flips to either a drought or a bad tide
	- In a drought water stops flowing from sources and starts receading
	- In a bad tide water sources start pumping bad water (toxic waste) which kills plants and makes your beavers sick on contact

### Map Layout
- 1) Your starting area
	- 2) A deep resevoir thats easy to damn
		- However, creeping bad water (11) from island 10 will start creeping towards the intake and toxicity will start or rise. A challenge for the player to overcome.
	- 3) A short river to build water wheels and industry around
	- 4) An easy area to expand to for a early game farms and later replaced by inustry
- 5/6) Nearby islands easy to expand to. Farming was in mind for these islands because of the irrigation and easy to clear folliage
	- 5) Has a cut between the 2 segmants that can be damned for irigation
	- 6) Has a small pond that will fill once a small amount of debris is cleared from the intake
- 7/8) Islands that can be reached through a relay from island 6. However this is quite far away from your starting place and provides an incentive to create a [second district](https://timberborn.fandom.com/wiki/Districts)
	- Both islands have a small water source and river to facilitate a second setup or industry expansions
	- Both islands have a clearing to telegraph a district build spot
	- Both islands have a damnable water source for drinking water
	- Both islands have abundant trees for construction
- 9) An island to expand to from island 1 with forestry in mind. Trees are hard to clear but provide more wood than normal trees.
- 10) An old human outpost
	- Bad water source to contain and harvest
	- Mid game opportunity for scrap metal harvesting from ruins
	- A underground entrance for a late game scrap metal mine

### The Challenge
- This is an opposite approach map which flips the [typical scenerio](https://timberborn.fandom.com/wiki/Maps) upside down
 - Typical maps are land locked with a shallow river running through it to provide horsepower for water wheels and water dries up during a drought
 - This map, water is abundant but current is scarce
	- Water drops a bit but stays around during a drought
	- However, when a bad tide season comes the map is now flooded with bad water that tends to stick around after the season inceasing toxicity around you
	- This is a play on to much of a good thing and water water everywhere but not a drop to drink

### Design Choices
- A challenging map different that its competitors on 3rd party sites
- Water is unusually ubundant but becomes a primary antagonist in the maps progression
- Progression:
	- Early Game:
		- Abundant resources and well telegraphed build spots
	- Mid Game:
		- Insentivising islands nearby to expand to in range of your central district but pushing the limits
		- Playes will experience their first bad tide and realise this map isnt as easy as one thought and a whole new problem is revealed when the bad water doesnt disipate easily
	- Late Game:
		- Multiple districts are required for shortage of land and high travel distances
		- Logistics setup will be needed for trade between the islands
		- Water toxicity is quite high and solutions need to be implemented to protect anyting on a coast line
