### Description of Game:

A game about a world in which humans have died out due to climate change, and beavers are now the dominant species. The player aims for a high well-being score by building a town with farms, industry, housing and entertainment without succumbing to the environment, hunger, or thirst.

Timberbornâ€™s game loop involves seasons that alternate between temperate weather and either drought or [badtide](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Weather#Badtide){:target="_blank"}.
- In temperate weather, water flows from sources and everything is in bloom.
- In a drought, water stops flowing from sources and water on the map starts receding and crops wither.
- In a [badtide](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Weather#Badtide){:target="_blank"}, water sources start pumping [badwater](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Badwater){:target="_blank"} (toxic waste) which kills plants and makes your beavers sick on contact.

### Description:

A custom game map created using the game's built-in map editor.

### Map Layout:
1) A lush starting area with [berry patches](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Berries){:target="_blank"} for plentiful food, nearby trees for construction and a river for [water wheels](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Water_Wheel){:target="_blank"}.

2) A deep water reservoir thats easy to dam. Surrounded by a bounty of berries and trees for construction [irrigated](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Fluids#Irrigation){:target="_blank"} through early droughts.
- However, [badwater](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Badwater){:target="_blank"} (11) will start creeping towards the intake increasing water toxicity. This presents a gentle challenge for the player to overcome and encouranges them to start thinking about this map's meta.

3) A short river to build industry and [water wheels](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Water_Wheel){:target="_blank"} for power.

4) An easy area to expand to for a early game farms, to be later replaced by industry.

5/6)  Nearby islands easy to expand to. These islands were made with farming in mind, with their dammable water sources for [irrigation](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Fluids#Irrigation){:target="_blank"} and easy to clear foliage.

7/8) Both of these islands can be reached through a relay from island (6). Since they are quite far away from your starting area, it provides an incentive to create a [second district](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Districts){:target="_blank"}.

Both islands have:
- A small water source and river to facilitate a [second district](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Districts){:target="_blank"} or industry expansions.
- A clearing as a telegraphed district build spot.
- A dammable water source for drinking water and light [water wheels](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Water_Wheel){:target="_blank"}.
- Abundant trees for construction.

9) An island to expand to from island (1) with the purpose of forestry in mind. Trees are harder to clear but provide more wood than normal trees.
- A moon shaped bay can be dammed but will be more challenging than other islands. The island's abundant trees will make local construction easier.

10) An old human outpost now in ruins.
- [Badwater](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Badwater){:target="_blank"} source to contain and harvest.
- Mid-game opportunity to harvest scrap metal from ruins for metal production.
- An entrance to [underground ruins](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Underground_Ruins){:target="_blank"} for a late game scrap metal mine.

### The Challenge:
- This is a map that flips the [typical scenario](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Maps){:target="_blank"} upside down.
 - [Typical maps](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Maps){:target="_blank"} are landlocked with a shallow river running through them. Water is your most precious resource.
 - In this map, water is abundant but current for [water wheels](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Water_Wheel){:target="_blank"} is scarce.
	- Water levels drop a bit but remains fairly steady during a drought due to the map's border.
	- However, when a [badtide](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Weather#Badtide){:target="_blank"} season comes the map is now flooded with [badwater](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Badwater){:target="_blank"} that lingers after the season instead of being flushed out increasing toxicity around you and creating challenges areas around coast lines. The map's borders that made droughts easier amplifies [badtides](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Weather#Badtide){:target="_blank"}. This is the turning point of the map and when the difficulties becomes clearer.

### Design Choices:
- To build a map different that those on [3rd party sites](https://mod.io/g/timberborn?tags-in=Map){:target="_blank"} or [base game scenarios](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Maps){:target="_blank"}.
- Water is unusually abundant but it becomes a primary antagonist as the maps progresses due to increasing [badwater](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Badwater){:target="_blank"} toxicity.
	- This is a play on "too much of a good thing" and "water, water, everywhere, but not a drop to drink".

- Progression:
	- Early Game:
		- Abundant resources and flat build spots.
	- Mid Game:
		- Incentivizing expansion to islands near your central [district](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Districts){:target="_blank"} while pushing the travel distance limits.
		- Players will experience their first [badtide](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Weather#Badtide){:target="_blank"} and discover this map isn't as easy as they thought. A whole new problem will be revealed when the [badwater](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Badwater){:target="_blank"} doesn't dissipate easily.
	- Late Game:
		- Multiple [districts](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Districts){:target="_blank"} are required due to shortage of land and long travel distances between them.
		- [Districts](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/Districts){:target="_blank"} and [trade](https://timberborn.wiki.gg/wiki/District_Crossing){:target="_blank"} will be needed between the islands.
		- Water toxicity is quite high and solutions need to be implemented to protect anything on a coast line or near a water source.
